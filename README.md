Bookmark Manager
===============
###A bookmark manager, similar to [Pineapple] or [Delicious] in spirit.

A website to maintain a collection of links, organised by tags. You can use it to save a webpage you found useful. You can add tags to the webpages you saved to find them later. You can browse links other users have added.

This is a good use case for exploring how relational databases work.

**Technologies: Sinatra, DataMapper, Bcrypt, RSpec and Capybara**
